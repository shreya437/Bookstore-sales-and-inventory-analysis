# Bookstore Sales and Inventory Analysis | SQL & Power BI

1. Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing bookstore sales and inventory data using SQL and Power BI to generate meaningful business insights. The project follows an end-to-end data analytics workflow, starting with data cleaning and preparation in SQL, followed by visualization and analysis in Power BI.

2. Purpose of the Project  
The purpose of this project is to understand bookstore sales performance, track inventory levels, and identify demand patterns. It demonstrates how cleaned and structured data can help businesses make better decisions related to stock management, sales planning, and product performance.

3. Data Cleaning & Preparation (SQL)  
Before building the Power BI dashboard, SQL was used to clean and prepare the dataset. This included:  
- Handling missing and null values  
- Removing duplicate records  
- Standardizing column names and formats  
- Correcting inconsistent entries  
- Ensuring proper data types for sales, price, quantity, and inventory columns  

Using SQL ensured the dataset was accurate, consistent, and reliable for further analysis and visualization.

4. Objectives  
- Analyze overall bookstore sales performance  
- Monitor inventory levels and stock availability  
- Identify top-selling and low-performing books  
- Understand customer purchasing trends  

5. Tools Used  
- SQL (for data cleaning and preprocessing)  
- Power BI (for data modeling, DAX, and dashboard creation)  
- Excel / CSV Dataset  

6. Key Insights  
- Book-wise and category-wise sales performance  
- Fast-moving vs slow-moving inventory identification  
- Inventory levels compared with sales demand  
- Trends in customer purchasing behavior  

7. Visuals Used in the Dashboard  
The Power BI dashboard includes the following visuals:  
- KPI cards to display key metrics such as total sales, total books sold, and inventory levels  
- Bar and column charts to compare sales across book categories and individual titles  
- Tables to show detailed book-level sales and inventory information  
- Filters and slicers to allow interactive analysis by category, book, or time period  

8. File Information  
- Power BI template file (.pbit) included  
- Dataset is not embedded and can be loaded separately  

9. How to Use  
1. Download the .pbit file  
2. Open it in Power BI Desktop  
3. Load the dataset when prompted  
4. Explore the interactive dashboard  

10. Outcome / Use Case  
This project showcases practical skills in SQL data cleaning and Power BI visualization. It is suitable for Data Analyst, Business Analyst, and Power BI portfolio projects, demonstrating the ability to transform raw bookstore data into actionable business insights.
